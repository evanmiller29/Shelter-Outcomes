# 003_Shelter_Outcomes
This repo outlines the modelling and submission process taken for the Kaggle competition: Shelter Outcomes 

See here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes

My approach is pretty basic at current as I'm learning more about the data science pipeline at the same time I'm learning Python.
At current my approach is utilising:

- Data mungling in pandas
- Model fitting in sklearn
- xgboost algo from the xgboost package

I'm trying my best to avoid over-fitting but since I'm just playing around with a number of these techniques it will almost definitely happen.
